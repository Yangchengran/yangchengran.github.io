[GPG](https://gnupg.org/) is also known as GnuPG, stands for GNU Privacy Guard. It is a built in program for most Linux systems and [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/about) for Windows. Starting from `2.19.1`, GitBash goes with gpg2 instead of gpg.

# Purpose of GPG

GPG provides two security protocols:

* Encryption
* Verification

To utilize GPG, you need a pair of GPG keys, one *public key*, which can be stored on public key servers e.g. <hkps://pgp.ustc.edu.cn>, and one *private key* which you should keep it safe.

## Encryption

GPG keys provides you a method to **obtain a file securely from others**. To encrypt a file, people need to have access to your public key and encrypt the file with it. Such encrypted file can only be decrypted with the private key you hold. The transition is secured as long as you have the private key in secret.

## Verification

The more commonly used protocol of GPG is to **verify a file whether it is sent from you**. If you want to publish a file, it might be modified or injected somewhere at midpoint before it reaches your target client. You can sign a file with your private key, and people can verify if the file they obtain is really theirs.

This protocol makes sure no one has modified the file so the client may not download some injected virus instead. The signature also makes sure no one can modify the history of git commits and tags without been noticed.

# Starting with GPG

## Generate a New Key Pair

To generate a new key, simply use `--gen-key`

```plain
$ gpg --gen-key

gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.22; Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection?
```

Default is sufficient for most cases, simply press enter.

```plain
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048)
```

Longer is more secure, but slower. 2048 is officially recommended. Simply press enter.

```plain
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)
```

For regular personal purpose, no expire date is necessary, as long as you can keep the private keys secure. So, press enter again.

```plain
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y
```

Type `y` and enter to confirm.
Then you need to specify your signature (uid) associated with the GPG key.

```plain
You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"

Real name: *****
Email address: ***@***
Comment:
```

This uid will be shown in the signature if you sign a file with the key. Real name should be no less then 5 characters, and the real email address is also required. Comment is optional, in case you have other references, e.g. GitHub alias.

```plain
You selected this USER-ID:
    "***** <***@***>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?
```

Check the spelling and enter `O` if you are satisfied. Then you need a passphrase to secure your secret key. *Utilize your disk is more efficient to generate random numbers.*

```plain
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
```

If it is your first time generate the GPG keys, you will see

```plain
gpg: ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key DDDDDDDD marked as ultimately trusted
public and secret key created and signed.
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
gpg: depth: 0 valid: 1 signed: 0 trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
pub 2048R/DDDDDDDD 2015-11-08
Key fingerprint = 886E 8FC9 A16A A092 1608 3BEF 6769 9021 646F 9037
uid ***** <***@***>
sub 2048R/FFFFFFFF 2015-11-08
```

The `DDDDDDDD` here will be the Hash of your uid, it can be used for later reference. It is also the id for your public key. To refer to the public key id, use `0xDDDDDDDD` instead.

To list existing keys, use `-k`, which is a shorthand for `--list-keys`

```plain
$ gpg -k
/c/Users/***/.gnupg/secring.gpg
------------------------------------
sec   2048R/DDDDDDDD 2015-11-08
uid                  ***** <***@***>
ssb   2048R/FFFFFFFF 2015-11-08
```

## Write Down Information

After the key pair is generated, you should store several important information.

### Public Key

The most important information is the public key, which can be obtained by

```plain
$ gpg -a -o GPG.public --export DDDDDDDD
$
```

This would save the public key to the file `GPG.public`.

Here `-a` is a shorthand for `--armor`, which is a flag indicating the format of output should be ASCII code instead of binaries. `-o` is the shorthand for `--output`, followed by the file name to output. `DDDDDDDD` is the uid (Hash).

### Fingerprint

Then you should save the fingerprint somewhere. The id of your public key may not be unique, and people could generate the same id to disguise as you. The fingerprint is the unique identifier of your. It can be checked by

```plain
$ gpg --fingerprint DDDDDDDD
sec   2048R/DDDDDDDD 2015-11-08
      Key fingerprint = 886E 8FC9 A16A A092 1608 3BEF 6769 9021 646F 9037
uid                  ***** <***@***>
ssb   2048R/FFFFFFFF 2015-11-08
```

### Publish and Request

To make sure others have access to your public key, you can send it to a keyserver

```plain
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://pgp.ustc.edu.cn --send-keys DDDDDDDD
gpg: sending key DDDDDDDD to hkps server pgp.ustc.edu.cn
```

Then people can find your public key on server with your name or email address:

```plain
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://pgp.ustc.edu.cn --search-key *****
(1)     ***** <***@***>
          2048 bit RSA key DDDDDDDD, created: 2015-11-08
Keys 1-1 of 1 for "*****".  Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit > 1
gpg: requesting key DDDDDDDD from hkps server pgp.ustc.edu.cn
gpg: ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key 646F9037: public key "***** <***@***>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)
```

There could be multiple entries. Enter the number would save that one to your database. Also, you can import the public key directly from a file:

```plain
$ gpg --import GPG.public
gpg: keyring '~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
gpg: key DDDDDDDD: public key "***** <***@***>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)
```

Remember to **check the fingerprint** before use the public key. If it is correct, you need to sign the key with your private key (for example `BBBBBBBB` here).

```plain
$ gpg --sign-key *****
pub 2048R/DDDDDDDD created: 2015-11-08 expires: never usage: SC
trust: unknown validity: unknown
sub 2048R/FFFFFFFF created: 2015-11-08 expires: never usage: E
[ unknown] (1). ***** <***@***>
pub 2048R/DDDDDDDD created: 2015-11-08 expires: never usage: SC
trust: unknown validity: unknown
Primary key fingerprint: 886E 8FC9 A16A A092 1608 3BEF 6769 9021 646F 9037
***** <***@***>
Are you sure that you want to sign this key with your
key "***** <***@***>" (BBBBBBBBB)
Really sign? (y/N) y
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: key "***** <***@***>"
2048-bit RSA key, ID BBBBBBBB, created 2015-11-17
```

If the fingerprint doesn't match, delete the key:

```plain
$ gpg --delete-keys jianxiangqiao
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.22; Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
pub 2048R/DDDDDDDD 2015-11-08 ***** <***@***>
Delete this key from the keyring? (y/N) y
```

# Utilize GPG

## Encryption and Decryption

To encrypt a file `demo.txt` with public key `*****`(name or email):

```plain
$ gpg --r ***** -o demo.en.txt -e demo.txt
$
```

`-r` here is a shorthand for flag `--recipient`, followed by the uid of the key.
`-e` is the shorthand for flag `--encrypt`, followed by the file to be encrypted.

The flag `-a` is also applicable if you want the format of output file to be ASCII code.

To decrypt the file

```plain
$ gpg -o demo-original.txt -d demo.en.txt
$
```

The flag `-d` is the shorthand for `--decrypt`, followed by the file to be decrypted.

## Sign and Verify

The simplest signiture is

```plain
$ gpg -a -s demo.txt
$
```

where `-s` is the shorthand for `--sign`, followed by the file to be signed. This will generate a file with appendix `.asc`, ect. `demo.txt.asc` (or `.gpg` if flag `-a` absents). This file can be verified with

```plain
$ gpg --verify demo.txt.asc
gpg: Signature made Tue 17 Nov 2015 04:26:02 PM EST using RSA key ID DDDDDDDD
gpg: Good signature from "***** <***@***>"
```

`Good signature` means the file is not modified after sign, and `Bad signature` indicates it have been modified.

To read the original file

```plain
$ gpg -o demo-original.txt -d demo.txt.asc
$
```

Note that, this process doesn't request any key. The signed file itself is not encrypted.

To skip the annoying output part, a separate signature can be generated

```plain
$ gpg -a -b demo.txt
$
```

The `-b` is the shorthand for `--detach-sign`, followed with the file to be signed. It would generate a separate signature file with appendix `.asc` (or `.sig` if flag `-a` absents).

The original file need to be in the same folder with signature files for verification (or the path need to be specified).

If the file to be signed is in ASCII format, the signature can be simply appended to the file:

```plain
$ gpg --clearsign demo.txt
$
```

The output is a `.asc` file.

Note that **the flag `-e` and `-r` can be used with signature, which also encrypt the file at the same time**.
